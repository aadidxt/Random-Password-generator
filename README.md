# Random-password-generator

This is a code of "Random Password Generator" i've created using python.
In this i've created a GUI(Graphical User Interface) which asks for the type of password you want, what you password should contain like digits, letters or all and in the next step you have to specify the length of your required password and after clicking on generate you'll get your random password and you can copy it also in your clipboard.

modules used in the code are follows:
1. Tkinter
2. string
3. random
4. pyperclip


-Tkinter is used for creating a GUI. 
-string is used to get digits, letters, punctuations without typing all required things.
-random is used to shuffle the password.
-pyperclip is used to help copying the generated password. 

you'll get the .exe file and the .py file and you can also download the .exe file and test the file.

# feel free to contribute to the code.
